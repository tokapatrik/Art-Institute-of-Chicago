React client application based on the API of the Art Institute of Chicago

*Artwork list
*Artwork details
*Favorite artworks

The “Artwork list” is a paginated list page containing 25 items per page by default. Each item is an
artwork with an image and a title. There should be controls for loading other pages, a selector to change
items per page, and a plain text search bar to load items based on the search criteria.

The “Artwork details” page contains detailed information about a single item. It displays the
image, title, information about the author and the department. This page also contains a favorite
button.

The “Favorite artworks” page lists all of your favorite artworks. There is a button to remove an
item from this list.
